Tests are failing, let's fix them
----------------------
the game will feature a voxel engine with small voxels that are untextured,
the voxel engine will use block ids of 1 integer,
the voxel engine will run a wireworld algorithm in 3d using colored (r/g/b) signals 
we need to be able to update the voxels quickly as a result
the voxel engine will load .gox files in 32x32x32 chunks, we'll have some multiple of 2x2 of these to form rooms
we will have larger rooms that may be 4x2 or 4x4, or perhaps extend in vertical direction
we'll eventually have a roguelite system connect these rooms together
There is a reference implementation for the voxel engine used in godot in the "references" project
Voxel data is listed under SearchitBreakher/content/voxels
