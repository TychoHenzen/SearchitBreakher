1. 3D Camera and Rendering
   - Display an RGB colored triangle (red-green-blue vertices) in 3D space
   - Implement a first-person camera system for navigation

2. Camera Controls
   - Mouse movement controls camera rotation (FPS-style)
   - Horizontal mouse movement rotates camera left/right
   - WASD keys move player relative to camera direction

3. Configuration
   - Store settings (camera sensitivity, movement speed) in a constants file
   - Serialize configuration to disk as JSON
   - Allow runtime modification of settings
